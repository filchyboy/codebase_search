# Lessons Learned: Fast Rebuild Insights

This document summarizes practical lessons and shortcuts for rebuilding `codebase_search` rapidly, focusing on speed and efficiency.

## Overengineered Areas to Simplify
- **Indexing Logic**: Unless handling very large codebases, avoid implementing a custom indexer. Native Python search (`os.walk`) is sufficient for MVP.
- **Complex Exclusion Patterns**: Start with simple glob patterns; advanced exclusion logic can be added later if needed.
- **Theme/Color Customization**: Stick to default Rich themes initially—custom themes can be deferred.
- **Interactive REPL**: Make this optional; core CLI commands cover most use cases.

## Unnecessary Features to Defer or Eliminate
- **Advanced Search Features** (fuzzy search, ranking, etc.): Not needed for initial release.
- **GUI/Editor Integration**: Out of scope for CLI MVP.
- **Persistent Search History**: Logging to file is enough for most users.

## Development Bottlenecks to Avoid
- **Custom Config Parsers**: Use PyYAML for simple, reliable config management.
- **Manual Argument Parsing**: Let Click handle CLI parsing and validation.
- **Reinventing Output Formatting**: Use Rich for all terminal output from the start.

## Alternative Approaches for Speed
- **Use Cookiecutter/Copier for Project Scaffolding**: Instantly generate Click-based CLI skeletons.
- **Rely on Third-Party Libraries**: Click, PyYAML, Rich, and Loguru cover nearly all needs—avoid custom implementations.
- **Code Generation Tools**: Use tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to quickly draft boilerplate code.
- **Start with Editable Installs**: Use `pip install -e .` for fast iteration and testing.

## Concrete Shortcuts
- **pipenv install click pyyaml rich loguru** (installs all major dependencies at once)
- **Minimal config file**: Only `base_dir` and `exclusions` needed for MVP
- **Single-file CLI possible for MVP**: Expand to modules only when needed

By focusing on these lessons, a competent developer can rebuild the project in a fraction of the time, without sacrificing core functionality.
